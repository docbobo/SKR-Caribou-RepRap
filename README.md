SKR Caribou Configuration for RepRap Firmware
=============================================

This is my working configuration for a Caribou/Zaribo MK3s 220 converted to SKR. Only difference to the stock Caribou are the BLTouch instead of the PINDA probe and the Moons motors instead of the LDO ones.

In its current state, the configuration tries to follow @codica2600's SKR Bear Marlin configuration (https://github.com/codiac2600/SKR-Bear-Marlin) as closely as possible.
