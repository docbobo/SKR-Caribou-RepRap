SKR Caribou Configuration for RepRap Firmware
=============================================

This is my working configuration for a Caribou/Zaribo MK3s 220 converted to SKR. Only difference to the stock Caribou are the BLTouch instead of the PINDA probe and the Moons motors instead of the LDO ones.
